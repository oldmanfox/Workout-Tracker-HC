 * A class capable of mapping a pixel point onto a datapoint, series and

 * This class is responsible for asking each series how far it is from a given
 * point, and ensuring the point is in the correct coordinate space for the
 * series. The chart also has hit-detectors whose responsiblity it is to be
 * asked and to calculate the distance to their series, for a certain point.
