/**
 For each ShinobiChart, one single SChartCanvas will exist to contain the drawing of all of the axes and series. Titles, legends and other chart level objects appear outside of this area in the ShinobiChart view. The canvas is responsible for managing the layers that make up the axis and series.
 
 The canvas itself has no objects drawn directly onto it. The canvas decides how much space it will need to draw any axis and their labels. The plot area view is then sized and laid down to draw the series. This is followed by the SChartCanvasOverlay layer that is used to draw the axes at the highest level.
 
 You should never need to modify this object directly.  We've included information on this class as we refer to the chart canvas at various points in our documentation.
