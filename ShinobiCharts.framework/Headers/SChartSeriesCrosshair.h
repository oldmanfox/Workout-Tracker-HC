@class SChartSeriesCrosshairTooltip, ShinobiChart;

/**
 SChartSeriesCrosshair draws a small circle around the current point being tracked, accompanied by a tooltip of type `SChartSeriesCrosshairTooltip`. This tooltip has a caret that points in the direction of the circled datapoint and is capable of displaying both single and multi-value datapoints.
 
 <img src="../docs/markdown_files/Images/crosshair_series.png" width=400/>
 
 To use this crosshair, simply assign an instance of SChartSeriesCrosshair to the chart's `crosshair` property: `chart.crosshair = [[SChartSeriesCrosshair alloc] init];`
 
 The crosshair is enabled with a _tap-and-hold gesture_ and will lock to the nearest series to pan through the values.
 
 In order for a crosshair to be displayed on a chart series, the series must have its `crosshairEnabled` property set to `YES`.  This defaults to `NO`, so you will need to set this property on the series in your chart.
 
 More details about this crosshair can be found in our [user guide](../../user_guide.html#Series-Crosshair).
