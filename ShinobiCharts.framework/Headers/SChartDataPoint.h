/** This class represents the data items contained within an SChartSeries.
 
 Each `SChartDataPoint` represents a _simple_ data point in a `SChartDataSeries`. The simple data point is made up of an x and a y object (not multiple x or y objects). It doesn't need to know what these objects are, it merely looks after them. Knowing how to interpet and translate these objects onto a chart is the job of the axis on the chart, which is an instance of `SChartAxis`.
 
 When creating a Radar or Polar chart using a `SChartRadialLineSeries`, use the xValue and yValue properties to plot your data. The xValue property stores data corresponding to the circular (radial) axis that renders clockwise around the chart. The yValue property stores data corresponding to the horizontal (polar) axis which renders from the center to the outer edge of the chart.

 More information about using SChartDataPoint can be found in the [user guide](../../user_guide.html#Data%20Points).

 When set to `YES` this data point will adopt a selected state. One effect of setting this property is that the style of the data point will change.  The series will apply the selected style to this point, as opposed to the normal style.

 NOTE: When altering this property's value after the chart has been rendered, you'll need to explicitly call the `redrawChart` method on the chart responsible for displaying the data point.
