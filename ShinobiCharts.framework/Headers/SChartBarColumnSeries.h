 - SChartSeriesOrientationHorizontal: Configures the orientation of the axis with which this series is associated to be horizontal. Thus the controlled variable will be drawn on the x-axis, while the measured variable will be drawn on the y-axis.
 - SChartSeriesOrientationVertical: Configures the orientation of the axis with which this series is associated to be vertical. Thus the controlled variable will be drawn on the y-axis, while the measured variable will be drawn on the x-axis.
 
 The orientation for bar/column series is vertical, and the orientation for column series is horizontal.

/** Specifies the style to use on a per-point basis
 
 This method is called for each datapoint in this series and the standard implementation chooses to return either the style or selectedStyle object based on the `selectionMode` and
 selected state of either the point or the series. _Computationally expensive operations here will increase initial render time._
 
 Use the `sChartXValue` & `sChartYValue` properties to access each datapoint's X & Y values. Here is an example of how to use these properties to style each bar/column:
 
 - (SChartBarColumnSeriesStyle *)styleForPoint:(id<SChartData>)point {
 
 SChartBarColumnSeriesStyle *newStyle = [super styleForPoint:point];
 
 float xValue = [[point sChartXValue] floatValue];
 
 newStyle.showAreaWithGradient = NO;
 
 if (xValue > 90) {
 newStyle.areaColor = [UIColor redColor];
 } else if(xValue > 50) {
 newStyle.areaColor = [UIColor yellowColor];
 } else {
 newStyle.areaColor = [UIColor greenColor];
 }
 return newStyle;
 }
 
 
 @param point The data-point that will be styled by the returned style object.
